# multi-zones-home

This project is a part of investigation POC about Next.js multi-zones. It consists of two apps (Home and Blog) that are "merged" into one using the rewrites, basePath manipulation and multi-zones technology.

You can find the other app (Blog) here:
https://github.com/vl4d1m1r/multi-zones-blog

Just clone both apps, and run them with `npm run dev` (both apps at the same time), then go to `https://localhost:3000`.
